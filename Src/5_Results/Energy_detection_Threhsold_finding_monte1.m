% Here we calculate the threhsold in energy detection by simulations. 
% This is a general method and applicable to all scenarios for energy detection.
% We assume that all the signals are complex Gaussian.
% Algorithm:
% 1. Assume onlt noise is received, i.e., primary user is absent.
% 2. If the only noise energy lies above the threhsold, it corresponds to
% false alarm.
% 3. Run this scenario for some number of iteration.
% 4. Probability of False Alarm = energy above threshold/No. of Iteration.
